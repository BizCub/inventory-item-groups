## Inventory Item Groups

This mod adds item groups to the Creative mode menu. It's based on a feature from the Bedrock edition.

## Usage

To use the mod, simply install it in the mods folder. In Creative mode, press the plus sign to open a group and the minus sign to close it. Neoforge doesn't require any additional dependencies, but Fabric requires the Fabric API.

## Other

* Initially, the ability to create custom groups was planned. However, no mod was suitable for customization. I planned for each group to have a list of item IDs and a menu tab ID. Another issue is that items are initialized only in the world, which makes it difficult to customize them outside of the game world.

* The Fabric API is required so that the game displays the translation keys instead of their values. This is because Fabric Loader doesn't load mod resources by default.
